[Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed \\u201cno debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be\\u201d (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). \\u201cI am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us \\u2014  the 400 of us,\\u201d Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom \\u2014  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for \\u201cempathy\\u201d for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented \\u201cBlack Power demagogues\\u201d and \\u201celitist arrogance and repressive intolerance\\u201d within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. \\u201cTrust,\\u201d Rodham ironically observed in 1969, \\u201cthis is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said \\u2018Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.\\u2019 What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?\\u201d The \\u201ctrust bust\\u201d certainly busted Clinton\\u2019s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people \\u2014  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November\\u2019s election \\u2014  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a \\u201clie,\\u201d a \\u201ccon,\\u201d \\u201calternative facts,\\u201d and \\u201ca   assault on truth and reason. \\u201d She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. \\u201cAs the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\\u201d she offered. \\u201cThat is not hyperbole. \\u201d Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that \\u201cfor too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. \\u201d Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. \\u201cWhy aren\\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\\u201d she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn\\u2019t president. The woman famously dubbed a \\u201ccongenital liar\\u201d by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in \\u2014  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.\",\n          \"Print \\nAn Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iran\\u2019s Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she\\u2019d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . \\nGolrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. \\n\\u201cWhen the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment \\u2013 without a warrant \\u2013 and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,\\u201d the article stated. \\n\\u201cOne of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery \\u2013 never published, never presented to anyone,\\u201d the article stated. \\u201cThe narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.\",\n          \"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \\nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \\nBy Lawrence Davidson \\nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \\nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country\\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for \\u201cregime change\\u201d in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \\nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \\nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government\\u2019s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \\nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \\nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \\nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \\nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out \\u2013 specifically, how to tell when they are getting \\u201ctrue\\u201d intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need \\u201c help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. \\u201d To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \\nA \\u201cpartnership\\u201d is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a \\u201c permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board\\u201d to coordinate programs in \\u201csocial and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .\\u201d \\nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the \\u201csocial and behavioral sciences\\u201d cannot give the spy agencies what they want \\u2013 a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \\nThe Believers \\nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth \\u2013 that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere.

However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors \\u2013 those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview \\u2013 have different criterion for what is \\u201ctrue\\u201d than do the analysts. \\nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council \\u2013 yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, \\u201c We\\u2019re looking for truth. But we\\u2019re particularly looking for truth that works. \\u201d Now what might that mean? \\nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, \\u201ctruth\\u201d must match up, fit with, their worldview \\u2013 their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not \\u201cwork.\\u201d So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by \\u201cgroup think,\\u201d ideological blinkers, and a \\u201cwe know better\\u201d attitude. \\nOn the other hand, as long as what you\\u2019re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory \\u2013 the list is almost endless. \\nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers \\u2013 the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class \\u2013 presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \\nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare\\u2019s determination that \\u201cwhat is past, is prelude.\\u201d Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will \\u2013 no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power.

The same principle applies to our daily wastes. \\nIn case you did not know it, Americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history. Actually, I would dare to say that we are the champions, my friends, and that\\u2019s nothing to be proud of. \\nWe waste at an incredible rate: absolutely anything, including food, where we lead the world by a wide margin. Also, as a nation, the United States generates more municipal solid-waste per person/per day than any other developed/industrial country in the world, boasting 7.1 pounds of solid waste a day, per person. \\nIf you crunch these numbers\\u2013 365 days a year x 330 million people x 7.1 pounds of solid waste \\u2013 you\\u2019ll come up with astonishing numbers. \\nPutting Waste to Work for Energy \\nIt was a Greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted \\u2013 everything gets transformed, or something along these lines. To follow this guy\\u2019s axiom, we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy . \\nWe, the preppers, can help mitigate the \\u201cdisaster\\u201d and put that amount of waste to good use, by making briquettes using daily wastes. \\nBriquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material \\u2013 usually coal dust, wood chips, paper, peat or sawdust \\u2013 that are used to start a fire. The terms derives from the French language and it means \\u201cbrick.\\u201d \\nBiomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass. Traditionally, biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and they\\u2019re used as a \\u201cgreen\\u201d replacement for hydrocarbons (coal, oil etc) in all sorts of applications, including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot. \\nCurrently, almost half of the world\\u2019s population is using charcoal and/or wood for heating and cooking purposes. \\nCutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives, and that\\u2019s the whole purpose of technology: making the world a better place and improving   humans, right? \\nAny household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak, by making \\u201cfuel briquettes\\u201d using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment. \\nHow to Make the Briquettes \\nSo, what type of wastes can be re-used for making fuel briquettes? Paper Charcoal fines Any other type of agricultural waste. \\nIt\\u2019s important to realize that not all waste is created equal, and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play. \\nAs a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to DIY fuel briquettes (sawdust, paper etc), but you\\u2019ll have to use a home-made press for achieving legendary status, i.e becoming energy self-sufficient as much as humanly possible. \\nThere are also commercially available presses. You\\u2019ll just have to look for them on the internet or in   \\nThe fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini Bryant and Peterson presses. You can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \\nYou can also use a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \\nBasically, you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette. You\\u2019ll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it, in order to get the water out of the mix. You can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag, a knife and some wire. \\nHere\\u2019s a cool idea about DIY-ing a mold-press biomass fuel briquette using an old DVD container. The possibilities are basically endless. \\nVideo first seen on nobodyprepper . \\nHow to Make Briquettes in Easy Steps \\nStep 1 \\u2013 preparing the briquette mix \\nFor example, if you\\u2019re going to use waste paper and sawdust (the simplest to DIY and very efficient and cost effective), you\\u2019ll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released, as these fibers will later bind the materials together. \\nIn the next step, you\\u2019ll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes, i.e. no pieces are evident in the \\u201csoup\\u201d. This step is very important but it takes some time and you\\u2019ll have to do it well. \\nTo speed up the process, you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently. \\nThe simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 3/4 parts sawdust. You can also add pine needles, rice husks, chopped leaves/grass, charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix, as they\\u2019ll add to the flavor. You\\u2019ll have to use roughly 20% paper though \\u2013 that\\u2019s the lesson to be taken home. \\nYou can alternatively swap paper for cassava peels/flour, which can replace the paper\\u2019s binding properties into the sawdust-mix. You\\u2019ll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft, but in sufficient amounts, the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together. \\nIn the next step, you\\u2019ll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water. The mix must hold together if squeezed; that\\u2019s how you determine the ideal consistency. \\nStep 2 \\u2013 prepare the press \\nThis step depends on whether you\\u2019re using a cool home press or an improvised device. Let\\u2019s say you\\u2019re on the low-tech side and you\\u2019re using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquette-making device. \\nYou\\u2019ll have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle (a soda bottle will do) and perforate the bottom, making 10-12 drainage holes. You can use a hot wire to burn the holes. \\nThen you\\u2019ll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle. Don\\u2019t forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too, both on the sides and in the bottom, so the water can be expelled during the pressing process. \\nObviously, you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle, like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot. Ideally you\\u2019ll have two of each: one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston. Don\\u2019t forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though \\u2013 otherwise, the water won\\u2019t drain and you\\u2019re wasting your time. \\nStep 3 \\u2013 press the mix \\nIn this step, you\\u2019ll have to put a quantity of briquette-mix inside the plastic liner (bag) and then insert the bag into the mold. Then you\\u2019ll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston (a can, the other bucket/another bottle or whatever fits into the mold) so the water gets pushed out of the mix. \\nPush as hard as you can \\u2013 the harder the better. Then you\\u2019ll have to pull the bag out of the mold and here\\u2019s your first briquette, folks. \\nStep 4 \\u2013 dry your briquettes \\nBut it\\u2019s not over yet. You\\u2019ll have to dry your briquettes for about a week outside in the sun. If they\\u2019re not properly dried, the briquettes will smoke when burned and that\\u2019s unpleasant to say the least. \\nIf you can\\u2019t improvise a mold and/or a press, you can always make fuel-briquettes with just your hands, squeezing the mix in your bare hands and building fuel balls and you\\u2019ll have to dry these out too, obviously. \\nThere are so many survival things you can do by yourself.   discover   wood creations. \\n\\n  5 total views, 5 views today\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.isnull().sum()"],"metadata":{"id":"5Wp4SXpsTYfx","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":178},"outputId":"3dd37a54-94c3-488a-d622-7c5069f34e83","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738215529954,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":565,"user":{"displayName":"anik hasan","userId":"10680641222234505841"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["title    1\n","text     0\n","label    0\n","dtype: int64"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df=df.dropna()"],"metadata":{"id":"cv8Q-EqrTjDM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738215534443,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":1203,"user":{"displayName":"anik hasan","userId":"10680641222234505841"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.isnull().sum()\n","#df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"mcC5ZIICTlZt","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":178},"outputId":"bcccf1c1-49f6-4677-9139-b07e50986ca8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738215539024,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":1071,"user":{"displayName":"anik hasan","userId":"10680641222234505841"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["title    0\n","text     0\n","label    0\n","dtype: int64"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['content'] = df['title'] + ' ' + df['text']\n","\n","df\n","#len(df)"],"metadata":{"id":"KASXz0PsxQ0r","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":597},"outputId":"15dea0f6-003c-4d62-aeaf-576d2f16eba2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738215543060,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":1088,"user":{"displayName":"anik hasan","userId":"10680641222234505841"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                title  \\\n","0   House Dem Aide: We Didn’t Even See Comey’s Let...   \n","1   FLYNN: Hillary Clinton, Big Woman on Campus -

[The new scan, developed by a   team of medical researchers, could replace the somewhat grainy ultrasound images parents are more accustomed to viewing during pregnancy.  UK video parenting site ChannelMum is sharing the video, created by the iFind project, which shows an MRI scan of a baby at 20 weeks. Cathy Ranson, who edits the site, says, \\u201cScans are amazing as they help mums, dads and even other family members bond with their baby. \\u201d    \\u201cThere is nothing quite as emotional as seeing your unborn child moving inside you, and these MRI scans are taking images to the next level,\\u201d she adds. \\u201cThey are truly breathtaking. \\u201d According to the Daily Mail, the new scan is also revving up the abortion debate in the UK once again since, with the new technology, parents and doctors can see clearly how fully formed an unborn baby is at 20 weeks. Currently, the legal abortion limit in the UK is 24 weeks. \\u201cHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously supported slashing the limit to 12 weeks and there have also been calls to reduce it to 20 weeks,\\u201d says the report. With a   administration now in the White House in the United States, national leaders who oppose abortion are hoping to pass the   Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban most abortions past the   mark, into law. Dr. David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at King\\u2019s College London who has participated in the project, says, \\u201cTaking pictures of a 20 week fetus while they\\u2019re still in the womb really isn\\u2019t that easy. \\u201d He explains: For one thing, they\\u2019re very small. The fetal heart, for example, with all of its tiny chambers and valves, is only about 15mm long: less than the size of penny. Ultrasound technology  \\u2014   used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK  \\u2014   is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures. It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back (\\u2018echo\\u2019) from the structures inside the body to produce an image. The MRI scan, unlike an ultrasound, shows what is happening under the baby\\u2019s skin, so that images can be obtained even of babies who move around frequently. \\u201cIn fetal ultrasound, the images produced can be excellent, but unfortunately, that\\u2019s not true for every patient,\\u201d Lloyd continues. \\u201cUltrasound has to be able to \\u2018see\\u2019 through the body to the parts of the baby we want to image, and that isn\\u2019t always easy. It will depend on the age of the baby, how they are lying in the womb, the size of the mother, and many other factors. \\u201d \\u201cMRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images, isn\\u2019t so limited,\\u201d he explains. \\u201cIt can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether there\\u2019s bone, muscle or fat in the way and in some cases it can give us even more detailed images than ultrasound. \\u201d \\u201cImportantly, it is also one of the few imaging techniques that is safe to use in pregnancy,\\u201d Lloyd adds.\",\n          \"License DMCA \\nA mandala is a visual symbol often utilized in meditation practices and teachings. The mandala symbol itself is a geometric construction of points, lines, planes and solids symbolizing the universe. Mandalas are geometric designs depictive of the universe specifically. Other designs are similarly meditation tools, but may not be mandalas specifically. The visually conceived geometric symbols are visual meditation tools. A visual meditation tool is called a yantra. Mandalas and all other yantras are visual meditation points of concentration. Yantras are visual meditative tools similar in value to points of concentration. The image above is the sri yantra, sri meaning king or most important. \\nA mantra is the audio version of a mandala. A mantra is an audio meditation tool. Whether the sound of the mantra is a single syllable tone or a series of lengthy metaphysical musings, a mantra is an audio meditation tool. Mantras, as sound vibration, are wavy linear vibrations of connection. \\nThe terms asana and mudra both reference physical positioning. An asana is a body posture as a meditation tool, and a mudra is a hand gesture or posture as a meditation tool. Asanas and mudras enable our own bodies to become a geometric representation of a meditation tool. The postures are physical meditation tools transforming self into one's own geometric figure or plane among the space and sensitive to the space of self and surroundings. \\nTantra means unification, or looming/weaving together principles and practices, instruction and individual action. Tantra unites entirety. Tantra signifies confluence and integration; a fusion. It is Sanskrit for loom, the device which weaves together string into cloth. It is an ancient word with many properties and has been variously used to describe the knots of strings weaved together in a rug, and the cord on which sacred mala bead necklaces were strung, (Mala beads are Tibetan prayer necklaces of 108 beads used to assist mentally or vocally repeating a mantra 108 times.) and practices of unification of individual with the universal. Today the word tantra is often used in reference to the union of lovemaking. Though there is also a specific type of yoga called Tantra Yoga it means unification. \\nThere is the potentiation of the unification of principle and practice. There is the potentiation of tantra of yantra, mantra and asana. And there is certainly the lesson of the potentiation of Yin Yang tantra. The combination of Yin and Yang potentials and energies within leads to all sorts of aspects of development. This can be energetically understood in the idea that there are only two types of energies, straight and circular, straight for Yang potentials and circular for Yin potentials. It can be understood on a tangible level that rest and work are both required. When straight and circular energies combine, a spiral results. A spiral is one of, if not the highest expressions of energy. \\nMore broadly and generally, tantra notes a mutually accepted connection, a tied knot of intertwined being, like lovemaking, but not necessarily beginning with or limited to the act of lovemaking. Humanity itself is a tantra; a fused weaving knot or many strings, of many instructions and many individuals. - Advertisement - \\nEssentially tantra is spiritual understanding of the relationship and connections between individuation and universal energies. An ancient spiritual philosophy preceding both Buddhism and Hinduism, tantra represents integration, unifying the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universal and the individual, the feminine and the masculine, the Yin and the Yang. It also refers to integrative knowledge and its continuation and building refinement through the interaction of teacher and student, signifying union and fusion; the acceptance, integration and transmutation of knowledge between individuals, like the string of life. \\nTantric ideas enhance and explore metaphysical merging of ideas and energies. Tantra is the merging of the physical and spiritual, through the merging of the conceptual. In essence, Tantra is the integration of yantra (the philosophy of visual symbols), mantra (communication of audio symbolism) and mudra (our very physical posturing) each of which is important on their own and increasing so when intertwined aspects of yoga, and life. Tantra unites meditation practices and enhances the individual unity expansion with entirety of the universal. \\nThere is not necessarily the need for a specific yantra, or specific mantra, or specific asana in meditation, however each are tools that can be used and considered, and most are most powerful when practiced in unified tantric manner, or tantric mind state. A tantric mind state recognizes unity expansion and aims toward it, rather than cultivating a mind state of separation. \\nNo matter how one approaches meditation the unifying tantra of our meditation principles and practices bring about the unity expansion of yantra no matter. No matter our level of refinement of posture, we are always in an asana, no matter if we utilize mantra, or yantra, we for th most part still see and hear and those who cannot can still concentrate and connect. And no matter the mantra, yantra or asana, it is the principles behind and pertaining to the symbolism that contains the real power, the highest potential for tantric connection. Yantras, mantras and asanas establish your sacred space and sacred perimeter and uniting with entirety in tantric balance. \\nSeed of Buddha Meditation - Advertisement - \\nOne of my favorite meditations relates to the four dimensions of geometry, but is extracted from Buddhist lessons. It is one of the most powerful meditations I have learned and as I learned it, Buddha himself practiced and taught this meditation. I learned this meditation from a Tibetan Buddhist monk from Nepal before I considered the four dimensions of geometry applied to meditation. On later examination however the components of the meditation relate to the four dimensions of geometry. \\nThis meditation is direct and simple, but can lead to infinitely complex profound lessons. The profundity of each of the ideas in this meditation cannot be understated. And each of the concepts has been elaborated on endlessly for centuries since Buddha, and so the presentation here is of course a simplification of the ideas and processes that might be endlessly explored and refined. And that is what meditation is all about really, our own personal inward exploration and refinement. \\nTo begin, sit in a comfortable cross legged position on a meditation pillow. Sit for a time to simply settle into absorption and relaxation, focusing on the breath. The rhythm of the following meditation consists of mindfulness of an idea followed by mindfulness of no idea, where as much as possible we think on nothingness. The nothingness gives us a chance to relax, compared to processing the series of ideas which can all be quite intense. The process can be done in any time period. The point is to cover each idea as deeply as can be, given time or mental state circumstances. \\nThe meditation is formed from important Buddhist concepts. Many meditations are derived from such teachings, Buddhist and otherwise, so that there are lessons in a sense for the secular, and meditation practitioners.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 99,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Massive Anti-Trump Protests, Union Square NYC Live Stream 17 mins ago 2 Views 0 Comments 0 Likes   New Zealand's   country's entire east coast and urged residents in low-lying areas to evacuate and seek higher ground.

[The new scan, developed by a   team of medical researchers, could replace the somewhat grainy ultrasound images parents are more accustomed to viewing during pregnancy.  UK video parenting site ChannelMum is sharing the video, created by the iFind project, which shows an MRI scan of a baby at 20 weeks. Cathy Ranson, who edits the site, says, \\u201cScans are amazing as they help mums, dads and even other family members bond with their baby. \\u201d    \\u201cThere is nothing quite as emotional as seeing your unborn child moving inside you, and these MRI scans are taking images to the next level,\\u201d she adds. \\u201cThey are truly breathtaking. \\u201d According to the Daily Mail, the new scan is also revving up the abortion debate in the UK once again since, with the new technology, parents and doctors can see clearly how fully formed an unborn baby is at 20 weeks. Currently, the legal abortion limit in the UK is 24 weeks. \\u201cHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously supported slashing the limit to 12 weeks and there have also been calls to reduce it to 20 weeks,\\u201d says the report. With a   administration now in the White House in the United States, national leaders who oppose abortion are hoping to pass the   Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban most abortions past the   mark, into law. Dr. David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at King\\u2019s College London who has participated in the project, says, \\u201cTaking pictures of a 20 week fetus while they\\u2019re still in the womb really isn\\u2019t that easy. \\u201d He explains: For one thing, they\\u2019re very small. The fetal heart, for example, with all of its tiny chambers and valves, is only about 15mm long: less than the size of penny. Ultrasound technology  \\u2014   used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK  \\u2014   is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures. It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back (\\u2018echo\\u2019) from the structures inside the body to produce an image. The MRI scan, unlike an ultrasound, shows what is happening under the baby\\u2019s skin, so that images can be obtained even of babies who move around frequently. \\u201cIn fetal ultrasound, the images produced can be excellent, but unfortunately, that\\u2019s not true for every patient,\\u201d Lloyd continues. \\u201cUltrasound has to be able to \\u2018see\\u2019 through the body to the parts of the baby we want to image, and that isn\\u2019t always easy. It will depend on the age of the baby, how they are lying in the womb, the size of the mother, and many other factors. \\u201d \\u201cMRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images, isn\\u2019t so limited,\\u201d he explains. \\u201cIt can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether there\\u2019s bone, muscle or fat in the way and in some cases it can give us even more detailed images than ultrasound. \\u201d \\u201cImportantly, it is also one of the few imaging techniques that is safe to use in pregnancy,\\u201d Lloyd adds.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"iAVzd7Rw90O0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#df['content'] = df['title'] + ' ' + df['text']\n","del df['title']\n","del df['text']\n","\n","df\n","#len(df)"],"metadata":{"id":"xP1LcCVfaNDo","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"outputId":"3bf7aaf5-e621-480a-edab-20e3c3599f9a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738215547905,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":875,"user":{"displayName":"anik hasan","userId":"10680641222234505841"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["    label                                            content\n","0       1  House Dem Aide: We Didn’t Even See Comey’s Let...\n","1       0  FLYNN: Hillary Clinton, Big Woman on Campus -

[The new scan, developed by a   team of medical researchers, could replace the somewhat grainy ultrasound images parents are more accustomed to viewing during pregnancy.  UK video parenting site ChannelMum is sharing the video, created by the iFind project, which shows an MRI scan of a baby at 20 weeks. Cathy Ranson, who edits the site, says, \\u201cScans are amazing as they help mums, dads and even other family members bond with their baby. \\u201d    \\u201cThere is nothing quite as emotional as seeing your unborn child moving inside you, and these MRI scans are taking images to the next level,\\u201d she adds. \\u201cThey are truly breathtaking. \\u201d According to the Daily Mail, the new scan is also revving up the abortion debate in the UK once again since, with the new technology, parents and doctors can see clearly how fully formed an unborn baby is at 20 weeks. Currently, the legal abortion limit in the UK is 24 weeks. \\u201cHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously supported slashing the limit to 12 weeks and there have also been calls to reduce it to 20 weeks,\\u201d says the report. With a   administration now in the White House in the United States, national leaders who oppose abortion are hoping to pass the   Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban most abortions past the   mark, into law. Dr. David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at King\\u2019s College London who has participated in the project, says, \\u201cTaking pictures of a 20 week fetus while they\\u2019re still in the womb really isn\\u2019t that easy. \\u201d He explains: For one thing, they\\u2019re very small. The fetal heart, for example, with all of its tiny chambers and valves, is only about 15mm long: less than the size of penny. Ultrasound technology  \\u2014   used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK  \\u2014   is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures. It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back (\\u2018echo\\u2019) from the structures inside the body to produce an image. The MRI scan, unlike an ultrasound, shows what is happening under the baby\\u2019s skin, so that images can be obtained even of babies who move around frequently. \\u201cIn fetal ultrasound, the images produced can be excellent, but unfortunately, that\\u2019s not true for every patient,\\u201d Lloyd continues. \\u201cUltrasound has to be able to \\u2018see\\u2019 through the body to the parts of the baby we want to image, and that isn\\u2019t always easy. It will depend on the age of the baby, how they are lying in the womb, the size of the mother, and many other factors. \\u201d \\u201cMRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images, isn\\u2019t so limited,\\u201d he explains. \\u201cIt can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether there\\u2019s bone, muscle or fat in the way and in some cases it can give us even more detailed images than ultrasound. \\u201d \\u201cImportantly, it is also one of the few imaging techniques that is safe to use in pregnancy,\\u201d Lloyd adds.\"\n        ],\n

Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u2019s review some of the US government\\u2019s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u2019s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u2019s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u2019s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u2019s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u2014 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u2019s destruction of Guatemala\\u2019s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u2019s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u201cnational security.\\u201d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u2019s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u2019s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u2019s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u2014 that is, people whose only \\u201ccrime\\u201d was believing in socialism \\u2014 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u201cnational security\\u201d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u2019 \\u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall.\\u2019 So they started attacking me. \\u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u201cThey were saying, \\u2018Islam, Islam!\\u2019 I said again, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u2019 \\u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u2019d be dead. \\u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u2019s really hard to imagine that he won\\u2019t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u201cF*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u201d has a nice ring to it.
